% AggregatePFFits_PreReg_7by9_11046
%
% The initial PF fits constrain PF slope within condition, but sometimes
% there isn't enough data to do that, and it makes sense to leverage more
% data and get the overall fit with constrained PF slope. This script does
% the aggregation.
%
% This version for 7by9 stimuli for 11046, for pre-registered data.
%
% RunAllInitialPFFits must have been run first, to put the data in the form
% where this program can use it.

% History:
%    12/04/21  dhb  Wrote it.
%    12/20/21  dhb  Add some data checks, save more data.
